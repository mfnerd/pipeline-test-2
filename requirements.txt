Flask

# Hello. This is Malgus from the past (3550 BY to be exact). A few of Flask's
# dependencies were recently updated that aren't backwards compatible.
#
# These packages are all dependencies of Flask and now we're locking them to
# a specific version that will work with the version of Flask we're using.
